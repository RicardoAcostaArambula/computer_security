If you have no clue where to start, checkout the "Ricardo" Directory and try to gain root access

From there you should traverse through each directory with some sort of key 

Eventually you will complete the final flag and recieve a congratulations message on terminal like the following:

Y   Y  III  PPPP  III  EEEEE EEEEE  !!!
 Y Y    I   P  P   I   E     E      !!!
  Y     I   PPP    I   EEEE  EEEE   !!!
  Y     I   P      I   E     E      !!!
  Y    III  P     III  EEEEE EEEEE   .
