# Welcome to {CTF name}
## Overview:
In this challenge you will have an opportunity to {} through a series of challenges that build on top of each other. Which means, you need to complete challenge 0 before challenge 1, challenge 1 before challenge 2 until the final challenge. The use of the terminal is highly encouraged. 

### Challenge 0: 
This challenge consists of gaining root access. You are logged in as a non-root user. And you need to gain root access. Pay close attention and the answer may be in plain sight. 

### Challenge 1: 
Challenge 1 consists of finding a caesar cipher key that you will use to decrypt the secret message in the next challenge. Now that you have access to root, it may be wise to look into what root can seeâ€¦

### Challenge 2: 
Well done! You made it to challenge 2! Now that you have the key, you need to find the encrypted message stored somewhere. Once you find the message, use the key from the previous challenge to decrypt the secret message. Numbers are encrypted as well.
